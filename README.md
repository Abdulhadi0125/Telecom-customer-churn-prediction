# Telecom Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project analyzes telecom customer data to predict churn (whether a customer will leave the service). Using machine learning techniques, we identify key factors influencing churn and build predictive models to help telecom providers improve customer retention.

## Dataset
- **Name:** Telecom Customer Churn Dataset
- **Description:** Contains customer details, services used, contract terms, and churn status.
- **Key Features:**
  - Customer tenure and contract type
  - Monthly charges and total charges
  - Services such as online security, tech support, and streaming options
  - Churn label (whether the customer left or not)

## Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identified trends, correlations, and key factors affecting churn.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, categorical encoding, and feature selection.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Applied multiple machine learning models, including:
     - Random Forest
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     - AdaBoost
   - Achieved up to **82% accuracy** in churn prediction.
4. **Insights & Business Impact**:
   - Customers with **month-to-month contracts** are more likely to churn.
   - Lack of **tech support** and **online security services** increases churn probability.
   - **Longer tenure and two-year contracts** reduce churn risk.
   - Recommendations: Offer better **customer support**, discounts for long-term contracts, and improved security services.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn** (for data analysis & visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning models)

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Telecom-Churn-Prediction.git
   cd Telecom-Churn-Prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore and execute the analysis.

## Results & Findings
- **Model Performance:**
  - Random Forest: **80% accuracy**
  - SVM: **82% accuracy**
  - AdaBoost: **79% accuracy**
- **Key Takeaways:**
  - Providing customer support and service upgrades can help reduce churn.
  - Predicting churn enables proactive customer retention strategies.
